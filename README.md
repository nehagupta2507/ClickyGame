This React application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicked on an image for the first time. The user's score will reset to 0 if user clicked the same image more than once. This project shows the use of React's components and rendering new states to the DOM on each click.
Every time an image is clicked, the images are shuffled in a random order.
The application keeps track of the user's score and high scores during the session. The user's score is incremented when clicked on an image for the first time.
