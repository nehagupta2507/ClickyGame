Memory game with React
Checkout the game [here](https://young-stream-38966.herokuapp.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

This React application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicked on an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if user clicked the same image more than once. This project shows the use of React's components and rendering new states to the DOM on each click.
Every time an image is clicked, the images are shuffled in a random order.
